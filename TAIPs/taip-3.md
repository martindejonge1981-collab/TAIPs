## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the TAIP.-->

This specification provides the messaging details for a simple virtual asset transfer between two parties as part of a Transaction Authorization Protocol flow.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->
This TAIP contains a specification for a metadata message about a virtual asset transaction for use as part of the Authorization Flow in TAP.

The primary type of transaction this defines supports the transfer of an amount of a fungible or non-fungible token from an originator to a beneficiary.

This TAIP only specifies the specifics of a Transfer rather than the complete Authorization Flow, as defined in [TAIP-4].

## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for TAIP. It should clearly explain why the state of the art is inadequate to address the problem that the TAIP solves. TAIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->
The Asset Transfer is a simple chain-agnostic representation of a typical virtual asset transaction and its parties. The vast majority of transactions performed by both custodial services and self-hosted wallets fall under this classification.

This specification builds on existing [Chain Agnostic standards][ChainAgnostic] such as [CAIP-10 Account Identifiers][CAIP-10] and [CAIP-19 Asset Identifiers][CAIP-19].

For developers of new blockchain protocols and token standards, make sure that you implement these and list them on the [Chainagnostic Namespaces](https://namespaces.chainagnostic.org) page for reference.

## Specification
<!--The technical specification should describe the standard in detail. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations. -->
Asset Transfers are implemented in the body of a [TAIP-2] message.

### DIDComm type URI

The preliminary URI to be used in the [TAIP-2] type header should be `https://tap.rsvp/schema/taip-3#Transfer`.

### Message Body

As specified in [TAIP-2] the message body is [JSON-LD]. The following attributes are defined:

* `@context` - REQUIRED the JSON-LD context `https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0`
* `@type` - REQUIRED the JSON-LD type `https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0#Transfer`
* `asset` - REQUIRED the [CAIP-19](CAIP-19) or [DTI] identifier of the asset
* `amount` - OPTIONAL for NFTs and REQUIRED for fungible tokens. Specified as a string with the full amount as a decimal representation of the token
* `originator` - OPTIONAL an object representing the originating (aka the sender) party (see [TAIP-6](TAIP-6))
* `beneficiary` - OPTIONAL an object representing the beneficiary (aka the recipient) party if different than the `originator` (see [TAIP-6](TAIP-6))
* `settlementId` - OPTIONAL a [CAIP-220](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/pull/221/files) identifier of the underlying settlement transaction on a blockchain. For more details see below.
* `agents` - REQUIRED an array of identity objects representing the agents who help execute the transaction. At minimum, there MUST be one agent whose `@id` matches the `from` field of the DIDComm message and has a `for` attribute set to the originator or beneficiary DID to indicate which party they represent. See [TAIP-5](TAIP-5) for more.
* `memo` - OPTIONAL a human readable UTF-8 string to be provided as-is by the originator to the beneficiary about the transfer
* `expiry` - OPTIONAL a timestamp in ISO 8601 format indicating when the transfer request expires. After this time, if no authorization has occurred, the transfer should be considered invalid and funds will not be sent. Recipients' agents SHOULD communicate this expiration deadline to their users when presenting the transfer for review.
* `transactionValue` - OPTIONAL an object representing the fiat equivalent value of the transfer. This is useful for compliance purposes such as Travel Rule threshold determination, particularly when the virtual asset is not widely traded and its fiat value cannot be easily resolved by receiving agents. Contains:
  * `amount` - REQUIRED the decimal string representation of the fiat amount
  * `currency` - REQUIRED the [ISO 4217](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html) 3-letter currency code (e.g., `"USD"`, `"EUR"`)

Many of the attributes are optional and through the process of authorization can be expanded and modified collaboratively by the agents of a transaction.

### Out-of-Band Initiation

To initiate a transfer with a party that hasn't communicated before, agents MUST support [Out-of-Band Messages](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/v2.1/#out-of-band-messages). The OOB message allows sharing the Transfer request through URLs or QR codes.

OOB messages for Transfer requests:

1. MUST use the `https://didcomm.org/out-of-band/2.0` protocol
2. MUST include the goal_code `tap.transfer`
3. SHOULD be shared as URLs according to the [Out-of-Band message spec](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/v2.1/#out-of-band-messages)
4. MUST include the Transfer message as a signed DIDComm message in the attachment

Example Out-of-Band message with Transfer request:

```json
{
  "type": "https://didcomm.org/out-of-band/2.0/invitation",
  "id": "2e9e257c-2839-4fae-b0c4-dcd4e2159f4e",
  "from": "did:web:originator.vasp",
  "body": {
    "goal_code": "tap.transfer",
    "goal": "Process asset transfer",
    "accept": ["didcomm/v2"]
  },
  "attachments": [{
    "id": "transfer-request-1",
    "mime_type": "application/didcomm-signed+json",
    "data": {
      "json": {
        "payload": "eyJpZCI6IjU5OWY3MjIwLTYxNDktNGM0NS1hZGJiLTg2ZDk2YzhlMDYwOCIsInR5cGUiOiJodHRwczovL3RhcC5yc3ZwL3NjaGVtYS8xLjAjVHJhbnNmZXIiLCJmcm9tIjoiZGlkOndlYjpvcmlnaW5hdG9yLnZhc3AiLCJib2R5Ijp7IkBjb250ZXh0IjoiaHR0cHM6Ly90YXAucnN2cC9zY2hlbWEvMS4wIiwiQHR5cGUiOiJodHRwczovL3RhcC5yc3ZwL3NjaGVtYS8xLjAjVHJhbnNmZXIiLCJhc3NldCI6ImVpcDE1NToxL3NsaXA0NDo2MCIsImFtb3VudCI6IjEuMjMiLCJvcmlnaW5hdG9yIjp7IkBpZCI6ImRpZDplZzpib2IifSwiYWdlbnRzIjpbeyJAaWQiOiJkaWQ6d2ViOm9yaWdpbmF0b3IudmFzcCJ9XX19",
        "signatures": [{
          "protected": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImtpZCI6ImRpZDp3ZWI6b3JpZ2luYXRvci52YXNwI2tleS0xIn0",
          "signature": "8KqJCbUdHMfN1etqy9_kyhVkw9h1Va3Z2vYu6dxZYuQM2XwYoG_5rFTvk3YH9xDRp5VxbXqnYYvKjHzjhBRzBw"
        }]
      }
    }
  }]
}
```

The `json` field contains a signed JWS with:
- `payload`: Base64URL-encoded Transfer message
- `signatures`: Array of signatures with protected header and signature value
- The protected header includes the key identifier (`kid`) that can be resolved through the signer's DID Document

The corresponding URL format would be either:
```
https://example.com/path?_oob=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJFZERTQSJ9...
```

Or using the shorter `_oobid` parameter that references a previously published Out-of-Band message:
```
https://example.com/path?_oobid=2e9e257c-2839-4fae-b0c4-dcd4e2159f4e
```

Where the `_oob` parameter contains the base64url-encoded Out-of-Band message, or the `_oobid` parameter contains a unique identifier that can be resolved to retrieve the full Out-of-Band message.

#### Transfer Amounts

The amount of a transfer is specified as `amount` and represents the decimal value of the asset. This approach is more intuitive for most users and application developers. It is the responsibility of library and tool developers to handle any necessary conversions when interacting with blockchain protocols that may require amounts in their smallest units.

As an example, `ETH 1.23` should be encoded as `"1.23"`.

#### `settlementId`

Use a simplified version of the format proposed by [CAIP-220](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/pull/221/files)

```
block_address:        chain_id + ":" [ + "block:"]? + "txn/" + transaction_id?
chain_id:             [-a-z0-9]{3,8}:[-_a-zA-Z0-9]{1,32} (See [CAIP-2][])
transaction_id:       [-%a-zA-Z0-9]{1,128}
```

eg:

```
eip155:1:tx/0x3edb98c24d46d148eb926c714f4fbaa117c47b0c0821f38bfce9763604457c33
```

### First and Third party transfers

If the `originator` is moving funds on their own behalf between their own wallets or accounts at different providers it is known as a first-party transfer. In this case only the `originator` is REQUIRED. The `beneficiary` can still OPTIONALLY be included for first-party transfers to indicate additional information such as account identifiers useful to the beneficiary institution.

If `originator` and `beneficiary` are different it is known as a third-party transfer.

### Agent Roles

[Agents][TAIP-5] can have specific roles vital to the execution of a transaction.

The following two roles can be used as attributes on Agents listed in the agents array:

* `SettlementAddress` - The blockchain wallet agent to settle a transaction to
* `SourceAddress` - The blockchain wallet agent used to send the transaction from

Neither of these is required but can be used to specify the blockchain wallets up front.

## Rationale
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->
This message type is designed to be as general and chain agnostic as possible and compatible with as little meta-data as possible, together with any required meta-data, that is useful for improving usability, safety, and record-keeping for a transaction.

Note this is designed to be used as an initial request message. The body attributes can be used as a representation of the internal state of a transaction by an agent, but do intentionally not represent the shared state.

It is also not intended to cover more complex transaction use cases, such as non-token transfer-related smart contract calls. This TAIP is encouraged to be forked and modified to create similar requests for Swaps, lending, and other everyday use cases.

## Test Cases
<!--Please add diverse test cases here if applicable. Any normative definition of an interface requires test cases to be implementable. -->

The following is a minimal first-party request for a transfer of 1.23 ETH from a trading firm to the ethereum wallet with the address `0x1234a96D359eC26a11e2C2b3d8f8B8942d5Bfcdb`:

```json

 "body": {
    "@context": "https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0",
    "@type": "https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0#Transfer",
    "asset": "eip155:1/slip44:60",
    "originator":{
      "@id":"did:web:originator.sample"
    },
    "amount": "1.23",
    "agents":[
      {
        "@id":"did:web:originator.sample",
        "for":"did:web:originator.sample"
      },
      {
        "@id":"did:pkh:eip155:1:0x1234a96D359eC26a11e2C2b3d8f8B8942d5Bfcdb",
        "role":"SettlementAddress"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The following is a request for a first-party transfer of 1.23 ETH from a crypto exchange from a customer to the ethereum wallet with the address `0x1234a96D359eC26a11e2C2b3d8f8B8942d5Bfcdb`:

```json
{
  "from":"did:web:originator.vasp",
  "type": "https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0#Transfer",
  "id": "...",
  "to": ["did:web:beneficiary.vasp", "did:pkh:eip155:1:0x1234a96D359eC26a11e2C2b3d8f8B8942d5Bfcdb"]
  "body": {
    "@context": "https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0",
    "@type": "https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0#Transfer",
    "asset": "eip155:1/slip44:60",
    "originator":{
      "@id":"did:eg:bob"
    },
    "amount": "1.23",
    "agents":[
      {
        "@id":"did:web:originator.vasp",
        "for":"did:eg:bob"
      },
      {
        "@id":"did:pkh:eip155:1:0x1234a96D359eC26a11e2C2b3d8f8B8942d5Bfcdb",
        "role":"SettlementAddress"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The following is a request for a third-party transfer of 1.23 ETH from a crypto exchange from a customer to a customer at another hosted wallet, which does not include settlement information. This allows the parties negotiate settlement as part of the authorization flow:

```json
{
  "from":"did:web:originator.vasp",
  "type": "https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0#Transfer",
  "id": "...",
  "to": ["did:web:beneficiary.vasp", "did:pkh:eip155:1:0x1234a96D359eC26a11e2C2b3d8f8B8942d5Bfcdb"]
  "body": {
    "@context": "https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0",
    "@type": "https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0#Transfer",
    "asset": "eip155:1/slip44:60",
    "originator":{
      "@id":"did:eg:bob"
    },
    "beneficiary":{
      "@id":"sms:+15105550101"
    },
    "amount": "1.23",
    "agents":[
      {
        "@id":"did:web:originator.vasp",
        "for":"did:eg:bob"
      },
      {
        "@id":"did:web:beneficiary.vasp",
        "for":"sms:+15105550101"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The following is a third-party transfer of a custom token with a provided fiat equivalent value. The `transactionValue` allows receiving agents to determine the fiat value for Travel Rule threshold evaluation when the asset is not widely traded:

```json
{
  "from":"did:web:originator.vasp",
  "type": "https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0#Transfer",
  "id": "...",
  "to": ["did:web:beneficiary.vasp"],
  "body": {
    "@context": "https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0",
    "@type": "https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0#Transfer",
    "asset": "eip155:1/erc20:0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678",
    "originator":{
      "@id":"did:eg:bob"
    },
    "beneficiary":{
      "@id":"did:eg:alice"
    },
    "amount": "500",
    "transactionValue": {
      "amount": "1250.00",
      "currency": "EUR"
    },
    "agents":[
      {
        "@id":"did:web:originator.vasp",
        "for":"did:eg:bob"
      },
      {
        "@id":"did:web:beneficiary.vasp",
        "for":"did:eg:alice"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The following is an example of a reasonably complete third-party transfer already that was already settled on the blockchain. An Agent could create these to backfill information about an already settled transaction.

```json
{
  "from":"did:web:originator.vasp",
  "type": "https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0#Transfer",
  "id": "...",
  "to": ["did:web:beneficiary.vasp", "did:pkh:eip155:1:0x1234a96D359eC26a11e2C2b3d8f8B8942d5Bfcdb"],
  "body": {
    "@context": "https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0",
    "@type": "https://tap.rsvp/schema/1.0#Transfer",
    "originator":{
      "@id":"did:eg:bob"
    },
    "beneficiary":{
      "@id":"did:eg:alice"
    },
    "asset": "eip155:1/slip44:60",
    "amount": "1.23",
    "settlementId":"eip155:1:tx/0x3edb98c24d46d148eb926c714f4fbaa117c47b0c0821f38bfce9763604457c33",
    "agents":[
      {
        "@id":"did:web:originator.vasp",
        "for":"did:eg:bob"
      },
      {
        "@id":"did:beneficiary.vasp",
        "for":"did:eg:alice"
      },
      {
        "@id":"did:pkh:eip155:1:0x1234a96D359eC26a11e2C2b3d8f8B8942d5Bfcdb",
        "role":"SettlementAddress"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations
<!--Please add an explicit list of intra-actor assumptions and known risk factors if applicable. Any normative definition of an interface requires these to be implementable; assumptions and risks should be at both individual interaction/use-case scale and systemically, should the interface specified gain ecosystem-namespace adoption. -->
It is essential to understand that this represents a request to perform a transaction, and requires all parties to verify all information in it to authorize and settle a transaction safely. The agents are responsible for confirming this information, even post-settlement.

## Privacy Considerations
<!--Please add an explicit list of intra-actor assumptions and known risk factors if applicable. Any normative definition of an interface requires these to be implementable; assumptions and risks should be at both individual interaction/use-case scale and systemically, should the interface specified gain ecosystem-namespace adoption. -->
This message can contain PII about end-users. Agents must understand their privacy duties under national law to safeguard their customers' PII. As part of a [TAIP-4] authorization flow, agents SHOULD evaluate the data privacy of any other agent before sharing PII with them.

Agents SHOULD minimize the use of end-user PII in this message, but it can be encrypted to specific trusted parties or agents separately. See [TAIP-8] for more.
