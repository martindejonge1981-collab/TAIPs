# Changelog

All notable structural changes to the Transaction Authorization Protocol (TAP) are documented in this file.

This changelog focuses on:
- New TAIPs and their acceptance status
- Message format changes
- Protocol structural changes
- Breaking changes

## [Unreleased]
## [2026-01-28]

### Changed
- **BREAKING: TAIP-15 Agent Connection Protocol**: Added explicit connectionTypes field
  - **NEW REQUIRED FIELD**: `connectionTypes` array now REQUIRED for all Connect messages
  - Transactional connections must specify `connectionTypes: ["transaction"]`
  - Added trust connection types: `ddq-access`, `mutual-trust`, `whitelist`
  - Trust connections enable DDQ exchange, mutual trust establishment, and whitelisting between VASPs
  - Field requirements now determined by `connectionTypes` value:
    - `["transaction"]` requires: requester, principal, agents, constraints
    - Trust types require: none (peer-to-peer relationships)
  - **Migration**: Existing transactional Connect messages must add `connectionTypes: ["transaction"]`
  - **Rationale**: Explicit type declaration follows industry standards (JSON-LD, OpenAPI, GraphQL)
  
- **TAIP-4**: Extended Authorize message with optional connection-specific fields
  - Added `approvedTypes` field for indicating approved connection types
  - Added `ddqDocument` field for DDQ document references
  - Added `trustLevel` field for trust status indicators
  - These fields are only used when responding to trust-based Connect messages (TAIP-15)
 
## [Released]
## [2025-11-25]

### Added
- **TAIP-19 ISO 20022 Message Mapping**: New specification for bidirectional mapping between ISO 20022 and TAP messages
  - Maps PAIN messages (payment initiation) to TAIP-14 Payment and TAIP-15 Connect
  - Maps PACS messages (clearing/settlement) to TAIP-3 Transfer
  - Maps CAMT messages (cash management) to TAIP-4 Cancel/Revert flows
  - Defines party/agent mappings (Debtor/Creditor → originator/beneficiary, BIC → did:web:, LEI support)
  - Uses RFC 8905 payto:// URIs for traditional account identifiers (IBAN, BBAN, ACH)
  - Includes status code mappings (ACCP/ACTC → Authorize, ACSC → Settle, RJCT → Reject)
  - Provides detailed field mappings for pacs.008, pain.001, pain.009
  - Documents flow diagrams for credit transfers, direct debit mandates, and payment recalls
  - Enables interoperability with SWIFT, SEPA, FedNow, and other ISO 20022 payment systems

    - Enables cross-currency payments (e.g., USD invoice accepting EUR at specific rate with IBAN settlement)
    - Supports volatile asset pricing (e.g., ETH, BTC) with precise amounts and rate expiration
  - **Updated composability section**: Replaced Transfer-based examples with Exchange/Quote pattern from TAIP-18
    - Shows proper use of Exchange requests for currency conversion in payment flows
    - Demonstrates parent-child relationship using `pthid` to link Exchange to Payment
