The Transaction Authorization Protocol (TAP) supports four primary transaction message types: **Transfer**, **Payment**, **RFQ**, and **Lock**. All enable compliant blockchain transactions, but they serve different business needs and workflows.

## Transfer

The **Transfer** message type is the foundation of TAP, designed for direct crypto asset transfers between parties.

### Business Use Cases

- **VASP-to-VASP Transfers**: Enables regulated crypto businesses to exchange customer asset transfers with required compliance data
- **Business-to-Business Payments**: Allows organizations to send crypto payments to vendors, suppliers, or partners
- **Corporate Treasury Operations**: Facilitates moving funds between company-controlled wallets
- **Exchange Withdrawals**: Supports customer withdrawals from exchanges to external wallets

### Key Characteristics

- **Originator Initiated**: The sending party (originator) initiates the transfer
- **Push-Based Model**: Assets are "pushed" from the originator to the beneficiary
- **Pre-Transaction Authorization**: Compliance checks occur before settlement on the blockchain
- **Compliance Data Exchange**: Allows sharing of identity information, purpose codes, and other compliance data
- **Purpose Code Support**: Includes optional ISO 20022 `purpose` and `categoryPurpose` fields to indicate the reason for payment (e.g., "SALA" for salary payments, "SUPP" for supplier payments) as defined in [TAIP-13](/TAIPs/taip-13.md)

## Payment

The **Payment** message type extends TAP to support merchant payment scenarios where the receiver initiates the request.

### Business Use Cases

- **Merchant Payments**: Enables businesses to request payment from customers
- **Invoice Collection**: Allows service providers to request payment for completed work
- **Recurring Payments**: Supports subscription-based business models
- **Donation Collection**: Enables charities and non-profits to request and track donations

### Key Characteristics

- **Beneficiary Initiated**: The receiving party (merchant/beneficiary) initiates the request
- **Pull-Based Model**: Beneficiary requests the customer to "pull" funds from their wallet
- **Enhanced Metadata**: Supports additional information like invoices, items, and payment terms
- **Customer Experience Focus**: Designed for consumer-friendly payment flows with clear merchant identification
- **Merchant Classification**: Supports ISO 18245 Merchant Category Codes (MCC) for business type identification (e.g., restaurants, grocery stores)
- **Flexible Settlement**: Supports flexible asset selection through the `supportedAssets` field, allowing customers to choose their preferred payment method
- **Fallback Settlement Options**: Includes `fallbackSettlementAddresses` field supporting both blockchain (CAIP-10) and traditional payment systems (RFC 8905 PayTo URIs) for redundancy
- **Invoice Support**: Includes comprehensive invoice functionality as defined in [TAIP-16](/TAIPs/taip-16.md), supporting detailed line items, tax information, and payment terms
- **Policy Support**: Can include policy requirements (e.g., RequirePresentation) for customer information needed for the transaction

## RFQ

The **RFQ** (Request for Quote) message type enables asset swaps and cross-asset quotations, facilitating conversion between different cryptocurrencies or between fiat and crypto assets.

### Business Use Cases

- **Cross-Asset Payments**: Enables paying in one asset while settling in another (e.g., pay USD, settle in USDC)
- **Currency Exchange**: Supports FX transactions between different stablecoins or fiat currencies
- **On/Off-Ramp Services**: Facilitates conversion between fiat money and cryptocurrency
- **Cross-Chain Bridging**: Enables moving assets between different blockchain networks
- **Liquidity Provision**: Allows market makers to provide quotes for asset conversions

### Key Characteristics

- **Quote-Based Model**: Uses a two-step process with RFQ and Quote response
- **Multi-Asset Support**: Handles arrays of source and target assets for flexible routing
- **Rate Discovery**: Enables competitive pricing through multiple provider quotes
- **Settlement Flexibility**: Can be combined with existing Authorize/Settle flows from [TAIP-4](/TAIPs/taip-4.md)
- **Escrow Integration**: Can leverage escrow mechanisms from [TAIP-17](/TAIPs/taip-17.md) for counterparty risk management
- **Provider Agnostic**: Supports both centralized liquidity providers and decentralized protocols

## Lock

The **Lock** message type enables third-party custody of assets with conditional release, providing security guarantees for complex transactions.

### Business Use Cases

- **High-Value Transfers**: Provides security for large transactions where parties want guarantees before settlement
- **Cross-Border Payments**: Enables conditional releases based on regulatory compliance verification
- **Contract-Based Payments**: Supports milestone-based payments where funds are released upon completion
- **Dispute Resolution**: Allows neutral third parties to hold funds during dispute resolution processes
- **Asset Swaps**: Facilitates atomic swaps between different assets with escrow protection
- **Marketplace Transactions**: Enables secure payments in peer-to-peer marketplaces

### Key Characteristics

- **Third-Party Custody**: Requires a trusted escrow agent to hold assets temporarily
- **Conditional Release**: Assets are released only when specific conditions are met
- **Automatic Expiration**: Includes built-in expiry mechanisms to prevent indefinite fund locks
- **Agreement Support**: Can reference external terms and conditions governing the escrow
- **Multi-Party Security**: Protects both originator and beneficiary through neutral custody
- **Capture Mechanism**: Uses separate Capture messages to authorize fund release
- **Integration Ready**: Works seamlessly with other TAP message types for complex workflows

## Business Differences

| Aspect | Transfer | Payment | RFQ | Lock |
|--------|----------|---------|----------|--------|
| **Initiator** | Originator (sender) | Beneficiary (receiver) | Requester (either party) | Any party (typically beneficiary) |
| **Flow Direction** | Push (send) | Pull (request) | Quote-based (negotiate) | Conditional hold (escrow) |
| **Primary Use Case** | VASP-to-VASP transfers | Merchant payments | Asset swaps, FX | High-value, conditional payments |
| **Compliance Focus** | Travel Rule, sanction screening | Merchant authentication, consumer protection | Liquidity provider verification, asset compliance | Escrow agent verification, conditional compliance |
| **User Experience** | Institutional/business-oriented | Consumer/customer-oriented | Quote discovery, price comparison | Security-focused, trust minimization |
| **Settlement Timing** | Typically immediate after authorization | May include payment terms/deadlines | Immediate after quote acceptance | Conditional upon escrow release |
| **Supporting Data** | Focuses on compliance data | Focuses on commercial transaction details | Focuses on exchange rates and asset metadata | Focuses on escrow terms and release conditions |

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing TAP, organizations should consider which transaction type best fits their business model:

- **Financial Institutions** typically focus on the Transfer message type to support customer withdrawals and institutional transfers
- **Merchants and Service Providers** benefit from implementing the Payment flow to collect payments
- **Liquidity Providers and Exchanges** use the RFQ flow to offer asset conversion services
- **Escrow Services and High-Value Transaction Facilitators** implement Lock flows to provide security guarantees
- **Full-Service Platforms** may implement all four to support various business scenarios including payments, transfers, asset exchanges, and conditional transactions
